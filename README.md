# odin-recipes
A sample project for The Odin Project

This project is apart of the curriculum on theodinproject.com

At first I made the index page along with creating the images directory, and realized I was committing both the index and the images in the same commit, and had to say something like "I added the index.html file and these images" which isn't a good commit message in my opinion. After that I made sure to be more careful on how much I am changing and what I am changing, so I don't have to explain too much in a single commit message.

I then realized I didn't read the rules correctly, and had to change the steps/cooking directions pretty drastically. Before I changed it, the cooking steps were written in a paragraph form above the ingredients. I had to make an entire section for an ordered list on all three pages and re-type the steps to make sense in that format. All in all I think I learned that I need to slow down a bit and not rush everything, because I ended up spending more time on certain things than I should'nt of in the first place.
