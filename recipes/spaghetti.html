    <h1>Spaghetti</h1>
	<img src="../images/spaghetti.png" alt="A bowl of spaghetti">
	<p>Spaghetti and meat (no balls). I love this and my mother served it all the time while I was growing up. The best part are the leftovers in my opinion. Once the noodles are stored together with the sauce for a day they soak it up and taste even better.
	  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1lb of ground beef</li>
		<li>1 whole onion</li>
		<li>1 bag spaghetti noodles</li>
		<li>3 cans of tomato sauce</li>
		<li>half of a garlic clove</li>
	</ul>
	  <h2>Step by step</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>In the beginning, we start boiling the noodles.</li>
		<li>Next, we brown the meat in the pan until it's barely pink.</li>
		<li>Then dice the onion and garlic, then add it to the pan.</li>
		<li>After a few minutes, add in the cans of tomato sauce. Just like the stroganoff, we'll add in a can of water so it isn't so thick.</li>
		<li>Stir until bubbling. Serve with noodles first with meat sauce on top.</li>
	</ol>
