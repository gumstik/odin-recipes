    <h1>Spaghetti</h1>

	<p>In the beginning, we start boiling the noodles. Just put the heat on a little bit above half and forget about it until everything else is done. This process is similar to making the stroganoff too. You brown the meat in the pan until it's barely pink. Then dice the onion and garlic, then add it to the pan. Make sure to stir the noodles every so often so they don't stick together.</p>
	<p>After a few minutes, add in the cans of tomato sauce. Just like the stroganoff, we'll add in a can of water so it isn't so thick. Stir until bubbling. Serve with noodles first with meat sauce on top.</p>
