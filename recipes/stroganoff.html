    <h1>Beef Stroganoff</h1>
	<img src="../images/stroganoff.png" alt="A plate of stroganoff">
	<p>So first, you throw the egg noodles in a pot of boiling water. While they are cooking, you begin browining the beef in a saucepan. While it's cooking, go chop up the onion very fine, or at least as good as you can get it. Add it to the cooking beef and stir until the beef is barely pink. Next, you'll add the can of tomato sauce to the pan. Use the empty can and fill it with water, and add that to the pan as well.</p>
	  <p>When it starts to bubble, add the entire stick of cream cheese to the pan. It'll melt quickly so don't worry about the chunks floating around. Lightly stir until the cream cheese has completely melted and serve in a bowl with the noodles first and then the meat/sauce combo on top. Enjoy!</p>
