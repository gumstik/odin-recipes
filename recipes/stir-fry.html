    <h1>Chicken Stir-Fry</h1>
	<img src="../images/stir-fry.png" alt="stir-fry in the pan">
	<p>At the start, take 1 cup of brown rice, and put it into a pot with 2 cups of water. <strong>Make sure you have a lid for the pot or the rice wont cook properly!</strong> Next, we slice up the chicken breasts into long thin chunks. Throw them into a frying pan. Stir the rice so it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan and turnt he chicken. When the chicken is no longer pink on the inside, dice the onion and whichever peppers you want, depending on if you want your dish to be spicy or not. Throw the onions and peppers in with the chicken strips and let them fry up.</p>
	  <p>Now check the rice. It should be done by now, if it isn't, turn down the heat on the chicken and let it simmer until the rice is done. When it is, throw the rice into the pan and add whatever sauces you'd prefer. Stir often and let the rice get slightly crispy and serve.</p>
