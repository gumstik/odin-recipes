    <h1>Chicken Stir-Fry</h1>
	<img src="../images/stir-fry.png" alt="stir-fry in the pan">
	<p>This looks like the most complicated of the 3, but trust me when I say it's the easiest. It tastes great too, and along with it being healthy, this is the perfect dish to serve to a family on a budget.
	  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1lb of chicken breasts</li>
		<li>1 whole onion</li>
		<li>1 cup of brown rice</li>
		<li>Assorted peppers of your choosing</li>
	</ul>
	  <h2>Step by step</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>At the start, take 1 cup of brown rice, and put it into a pot with 2 cups of water. <strong>Make sure you have a lid for the pot or the rice wont cook properly!</strong></li>
		<li>Next, we slice up the chicken breasts into long thin chunks. Throw them into a frying pan.</li>
		<li>When the chicken is no longer pink on the inside, dice the onion and whichever peppers you want, depending on if you want your dish to be spicy or not.</li>
		<li>Throw the onions and peppers in with the chicken strips and let them fry up.</li>
		<li>Now check the rice. It should be done by now, if it isn't, turn down the heat on the chicken and let it simmer until the rice is done.</li>
		<li>When it is, throw the rice into the pan and add whatever sauces you'd prefer. Stir often and let the rice get slightly crispy and serve.</li>
	</ol>
