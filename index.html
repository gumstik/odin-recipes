		<p>Here's a recipe for <a href="./recipes/stroganoff.html">beef stroganoff</a> that's to die for.</p>
		<p>This recipe for  <a href="./recipes/stir-fry.html">chicken stir-fry</a> is <strong>really</strong> good too!</p>
		<p>But in all honesty, my absolute FAVORITE has to be this recipe for  <a href="./recipes/spaghetti.html">spaghetti</a>.</p>
